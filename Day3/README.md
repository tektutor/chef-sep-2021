Generating Chef Infra repo chef-repo
- Ensuring correct Chef Infra repo file content

Your new Chef Infra repo is ready! Type `cd chef-repo` to enter it.

### Let us now write our first Chef Cookbook inside the chef-repo.

So far we wrote individual Chef recipes but now it is time to write a Cookbook !

Cookbook is nothing but a set of recipes invoked in a particular sequence.

```
cd ~
cd Training/Day3
cd chef-repo/cookbooks
chef generate cookbook webserver
```

The expected output is
<pre>
[jegan@tektutor Day3]$ cd chef-repo/cookbooks
[jegan@tektutor Day3]$ chef generate cookbook webserver
Generating cookbook webserver
- Ensuring correct cookbook content

Your cookbook is ready. Type `cd webserver` to enter it.

There are several commands you can run to get started locally developing and testing your cookbook.
Type `delivery local --help` to see a full list of local testing commands.

Why not start by writing an InSpec test? Tests for the default recipe are stored at:

test/integration/default/default_test.rb

If you'd prefer to dive right in, the default recipe can be found at:

recipes/default.rb
</pre>

Let us now get inside the Cookbook directory as shown below and edit the default.rb file under recipes folder.
```
cd webserver/recipes
vim default.rb
```

You may now append the below code in the default.rb file and save it.

```
package 'httpd' do
  action :install
end

file '/var/www/html/index.html' do
  content "<h1>Welcome to Httpd WebServer Landing Page !</h1>"
  action :create
end

service 'httpd' do
  action [:enable, :start]
end
```

Let's dry-run the cookbook locally as shown below from 'chef-repo' folder
```
pwd
sudo chef-client --local-mode cookbooks/webserver/recipes/default.rb --why-run
```
<pre>
[jegan@tektutor chef-repo]$ pwd

### Include Recipe
We can break the larger recipe file with multiple resource calls into smaller moduler recipes with this feature.

This helps us in writing modular, readable and easy to maintain recipes.

Before refactoring default.rb
```
package 'httpd' do
  action :install
end

file '/var/www/html/index.html' do
  content "<h1>Welcome to Httpd WebServer Landing Page !</h1>"
  action :create
end

service 'httpd' do
  action [:enable, :start]
end
```

After refactoring default.rb

This is how the default.rb will look after refactoring
```
include_recipe 'webserver::install-httpd'
include_recipe 'webserver::deploy-custom-html'
include_recipe 'webserver::start-webserver'
```

The install-httpd.rb file will look as shown below
```
# Install httpd webserver in CentOS/RedHat Linux Family
package 'httpd' do
  action :install
end
```

The deploy-custom-html.rb file will look as shown below
```
# Deploy the custom web page into httpd webserver
file '/var/www/html/index.html' do
  content "<h1>Welcome to Httpd WebServer Landing Page !</h1>"
  action :create
end
```

The start-webserver.rb file will look as shown below
```
# Start the httpd service
service 'httpd' do
  action [:enable, :start]
end
```

### Let us upload the cookbook to actual server
```
cd ~/Training/chef-sep-2021/Day3/chef-repo/cookbooks
knife cookbook upload "webserver" --cookbook-path .
```

The expected output is
<pre>
[jegan@workstation cookbooks]$ ls
example  README.md  webserver
[jegan@workstation cookbooks]$ knife cookbook upload "webserver" --cookbook-path .
Uploading webserver      [0.1.0]
Uploaded 1 cookbook.
</pre>

### RunList
Runlist is a way we can control the order in which multiple recipes should be executed by the chef-client in a required order.

Syntax looks as below
```
chef-client --runlist "recipe[Cookbook-Name::Recipe-Name]"
chef-client --runlist "recipe[Cookbook-Name]
chef-client --runlist "recipe[Cookbane-Name1::default],recipe[Cookbook-Name2::recipe-name]"
```

Let us add the webserver cookbook to the runlist of node1 and node2
```
cd ~/Training/chef-sep-2021
git pull
cd Day3/chef-repo/cookbooks

knife node run_list add node1 "recipe[webserver]"
knife node run_list add node2 "recipe[webserver]"
```

The expected output is
<pre>
[jegan@workstation cookbooks]$<b> knife node run_list add node1 "recipe[webserver]" <b>
node1:
  run_list:
    recipe[httpd]
    recipe[webserver]
[jegan@workstation cookbooks]$ knife node run_list add node2 "recipe[webserver]"
node2:
  run_list:
    recipe[apache]
    recipe[webserver]
</pre>
